# odin-recipes

This is my first attempt at making a recipes collection page. WARNING! It will probably be the ugliest thing you've laid eyes on. Viewer discretion is advised.

Skills I will have demonstrated once I'm done:

- Basic HTML elements
- Git command line

Self-reflection:

I learned that `git add .` starts at the current folder and works into each sub-folder as appropriate. But it does not go _up_
