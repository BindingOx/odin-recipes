    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Simmered Fruit is arguably the easiest dish to cook in the early game due
      to the abundance of apples you'll end up having once you're done with the
      Great Plateau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although you can simply use one apple to cook the dish, it's best to max
      it out and use five apples. This will create a Simmered Fruit that
      restores five hearts
