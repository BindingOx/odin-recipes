    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Meaty Rice Balls are another good starting recipe. As with all meat
      recipes, higher quality meat will result in more health restored!

      It's also possible to add additional effects to the recupe. Adding a
      Stamella Shroom to the recipe creates Energizing Meaty Rice Balls, which
      also restores Link's Stamina Wheel!
