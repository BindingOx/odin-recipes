    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The basic Meat and Mushroom Skewer restores three Heart Containers is
      another great food item to prepare in the early game. The basic version
      only requires at least one piece of meat of any kind and Hylian Shrooms.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use different mushrooms to provide certain food buffs.
      Creating a Meat Skewer with an Ironshroom, for example, will create a
      Tough Meat and Mushroom Skewer that increases Link's defense temporarily!
    </p>
    <p>
      As with all meat recipes, higher quality meat will result in more health
      restored!
